# User Interaction (UI), User Experience (UX), HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) & Frameworks
Key goals are:
1. Understand fundamental principles of UI/UX design and HCI.
2. Recognize the role of usability and user-centered design in software development.
3. Identify key design elements that contribute to a positive user experience.

## User Interaction vs User Experience
These are very intertwined, as the design and implementation of a _user interface_ dictates the types of _user interactions_ and, therefore, dictates the overall _user experience_. 

**UI (User _Interface_)**  
- Choosing appropriate affordances and signifiers.
  - Affordances: the characteristics of an object or space that indicate how it can be used or how to interact with it.
  - Signifiers: perceptible cues that designers include in (eg) interfaces so users can easily discover what to do.
- The look and feel of the interface, 
- Visual design elements like colors, typography, buttons, and layout.
- Aiming for aesthetically pleasing and consistent

**UI (User _Interaction_)**
- Includes actions or gestures like clicking, swiping, and typing, which are responses to affordances.
- Deals with interactive elements like buttons, gestures, and response times.
- Concerned with making interactions smooth, responsive, and intuitive.
- Aims to reduce user effort and make completing tasks straightforward.

**UX (User _Experience_)**  
- Deals with the functionality, usability, and satisfaction of the interaction.
- Concerned with user journey, accessibility, and problem-solving.
- Aims to create a seamless, enjoyable, and meaningful user experience.

## Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Human-Computer Interaction focuses on understanding how a human interprets and interacts with a computer.
  - Studies usability, ergonomics, and the impact of design on users
- This is a broad field of study, and frequently out of scope for the "normal" developer, but it is generally a good idea to keep certain things in mind.
  - Interdisciplinary field focusing on how people interact with computers and technology.
  - Integrates principles from psychology, design, computer science, and engineering.
- Aims to create interfaces that are intuitive, efficient, and accessible to a diverse user base.
- Involves methods like user testing, prototyping, and iterative design for continuous improvement.
- User-centered design to make technology more adaptable and responsive to human needs.

## Core UI/UX & HCI Principles
- **Usability**: Definition and components (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction).
   - **User-Centered Design (UCD)**: Emphasize user involvement in the design process.
   - **Affordance & Signifiers**: Elements that make UI interactions intuitive.
   - **Feedback & Visibility**: Highlight the importance of providing users with cues about system status.
   - **Accessibility**: Overview of designing for diverse users (e.g., color contrast, screen readers).
   - **Consistency**: Importance of uniform design across the application.
   - **Interaction Design**: Discuss design patterns that improve interaction (navigation, layout, etc.).
