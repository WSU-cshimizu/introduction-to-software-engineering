# Testing

## Correctness (Algorithmic)
* Sound and Complete
* Formal Methods, Logics & Proofs
* Guarantees, Type-checking, Promises, Assertions

## Correctness (System)

**Validation**
* Software Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610]

**Verification**
* Software Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE-STD-610]

## Testing Frameworks

* Unit Testing
* Functional Testing
* Regression Testing
* Black Box Testing
* Integration Testing
* Keyword Testing
* Data Driven Testing
* Smoke Testing

-----

**Combining Tests**
* Linear Automation Framework (Record & Playback)
* Modular Automation Framework
* Data-Driven Framework
* Keyword-Driven Framework
* Hybrid Automation Framework
* Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Framework

-----

**Software Libraries for testing**
* There are many implemented frameworks
	* Selenium
	* Cucumber
	* Cypress
	* Puppeteer
	* ...
* Many are also language specific

## Test-Driven Development

* Write the tests first, then write the code to satisfy them.

-----
**The Steps**
1. List scenarios for the new feature
2. Write a test for an item on the list
3. Run all tests. The new test should fail â€“ for expected reasons
4. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
5. All tests should now pass
6. Refactor as needed while ensuring all tests continue to pass
7. Repeat
