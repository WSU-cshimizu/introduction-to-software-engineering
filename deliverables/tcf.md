# Team Composition Form
For this deliverable, you will prepare a report that
* Defines your team
* Justifies its composition

**Requirement:** No team may consist of only graduate students. Each team must have at least one graduate student in it before doubling up may occur.

## Suggestions
Attempt to find mixes of experiences and expertise, not just your friends, such as finding people that like databases, are capable of writing html/css, or have specific expertise in languages.

## Requirements
* Name of team
* List of members, and for each member:
  * include contact info (i.e., email, wid, github username)
  * include resume/CVs or other documentation
* Justification for team composition
  * 250-300 word summary, referencing the documentation from above:	
	* report on the breadth of experience across team
	* report on the depth of experience across team

## Submission Details
* Each student is expected to submit their own document to the Pilot dropbox. 
  * This is the only time we will use Pilot as a submission mechanism.
  * All team members should submit exactly the same form, as this is how we will track initial team formation.
* The document must be submitted as a PDF, and zipped into an `.ZIP` archive alongside the supporting documentation.

## Rubric
Recall that each point corresponds to point of your final grade.
