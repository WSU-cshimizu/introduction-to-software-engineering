## Details
* Testing Plan -- what testing elements will be incorporated 
* Testing Framework -- choose an existing testing automation framework, or "roll your own".
* Justify your choice of plan. Minimally, "Does it fit into the team software development plan?"
* Justify your choice of framework (or lack thereof). Minimally, "Is this achievable?" and "Does this adequately test the system?"
